! 43-MT-1/5-Comma
!
! 43-tone scale in extended 1/5 Syntonic Comma meantone. Each fifth in the range d♭♭♭-d♯♯♯ is narrowed from its JI ratio (3/2) by 1/5 of a Syntonic Comma (81/80 = ca. 21.5c), so that five successive fifths produce a major seventh (15/8). Standard 12-tone meantone usually ranges from E♭ to G♯, leaving a so-called "wolf" fifth. By extending the tuning to 43 notes, a circulating well-temperament is produced.
