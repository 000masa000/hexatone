43-tone 11-Limit Rational Intonation scale by Harry Partch, consisting of 43 divisions per octave derived symmetrically from both harmonic and subharmonic series (otonalities and utonalities) up to a prime limit of 11. Partch’s original tuning was based on 1/1 = G (392 Hz), while this scala file uses the standard reference tone C. Therefore, each of Partch’s ratios have been multiplied by 3/2 and normalised, so that the original pitch-heights are retained.
