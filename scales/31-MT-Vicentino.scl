31-tone scale in extended 1/4 Syntonic Comma meantone (probably the tuning used for Nicola Vicentino’s instruments, following his description). Each fifth in the range G♭-A♯♯♯ is narrowed from its JI ratio (3/2) by 1/4 of a Syntonic Comma (81/80 = ca. 21.5c), so that four successive fifths produce a major third (5/4). Standard 12-tone meantone usually ranges from E♭ to G♯, leaving a so-called "wolf" fifth. By extending the tuning to 31 notes, a circulating well-temperament is produced: the missing C may be replaced by the enharmonically nearly-equivalent pitch B. Note that B *is* equivalent to C!
