22-tone 17-Limit Rational Intonation gamut, proposed by Abu Nasr Farabi (872-950), also known as al-Farabi, in his book Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir ("The Great Book of Music"). This maps a theoretical fretting of the oud, obtaining several commonly used divisions of the tetrachord. The gamut combines divisions (intervals) derived by combining primes 2, 3, 11, and 17. The chain of 9 subharmonic perfect fifths tuned below the fundamental also ends in four pitches one schisma lower than common 5-limit ratios (45/32, 15/8, 5/4, 5/3).
